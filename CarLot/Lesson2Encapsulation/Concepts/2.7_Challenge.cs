		// Improve the encapsulation of your car class:

		// 1) Prevent outside forces from changing a car's attributes that should not be editable



		// Build a lot that can:

		// 1) Contain any type of thing.
		// 2) Output a summary of its things.
		// 3) Output all of the things in the lots.

		// ** Bonus ** Allow removal of things from the lot by a unique identifier
