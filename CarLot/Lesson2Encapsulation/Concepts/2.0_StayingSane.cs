		// Encapsulation / Separation of Concerns (not unique to C#)

		// Where does the power and usefulness of pieces of code come from?

		// One metric is the scope of responsibility

		// Encapsulation tries to answer the question, "How does it do it?" with, "It doesn't matter."

		// It also helps us stay sane inside large projects, by creating separation of concerns



		// List<T> as an example

		// https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Collections/Generic/List.cs,cf7f4095e4de7646

		// I've never looked at this file before, because I know what list does and it does that, and only that



		// The power of C# like any language comes from using the work of others (.NET built-in functionality, NuGet packages, etc.)

		// Understanding how magic is happening, even in code that we did not write, is helpful

		// Understanding will also help us extend something or create something new
